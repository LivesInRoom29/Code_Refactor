# Code_Refactor

## Description

With this project, I have taken the **HTML** and **CSS** files for a website and refactored them in order to make the code more _accessible_ and _sustainable_.

## Refactoring

Some examples of changes that were made include:
* Adding _alt_ labels to images
* Fixing broken links
* Changed most div tags to use more specific tags like nav, footer, main, aside, etc
* Improved _title_ for the website.
* Consolidated _CSS selctors_ and _properties_ so that there were not unecessary duplicates. Also, organized the selectors so they matched up better with the structure of the HTML.
* Added _comments_ to HTML and CSS files.

Additional changes not necessarily needed for accessibility and sustainablilty:
* Added _flexboxes_ to improve the wrapping of text as the viewport size decreases.


## Learning Outcomes

* HTML semantics
  * Proper, specific tags to used in different sections.
  * Accessibility requirements for websites and how to implement them.
  * Commenting to make code more readable.


* Cascading styles
  * How to use selectors, classes, and IDs so that they are cascading, not just applying the same properties over and over to multiple objects.
  * Commenting to make code more readable.

* Git and Github
  * Learned to utilize **Git** for version control.
  * Learned to utilize **GitHub** to store and share my repository.
  * Markdown syntax for README files.


## Credits

Thanks to the UNH Bootcamp instructors, TAs, and tutors for helping me to learn and apply the material.

Thanks as well to my classmates for their awesome questions in class and during office hours, which definitely helped me to understand better.
